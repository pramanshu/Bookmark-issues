I fixed it doing this:

I uninstalled completely cocoapods (my version was 1.11.0)

gem list --local | grep cocoapods

cocoapods-core (1.11.0) cocoapods-deintegrate (1.0.5) cocoapods-downloader (1.5.0) cocoapods-plugins (1.0.0) cocoapods-search (1.0.1) cocoapods-trunk (1.6.0) cocoapods-try (1.2.0)

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-core

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-deintegrate

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-downloader

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-plugins

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-search

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-trunk

sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-try

Then i installed cocoapods version 1.10.1 (you can try with more versions under 1.11.0 if you need)

sudo gem install cocoapods -v 1.10.1
